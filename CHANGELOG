# 9.2.2

* Includes fix to get the mock_gds_sso_api_access
  strategy working in development for apps that
  don't have a role attribute on User.

# 9.2.1

* Using User#where instead of User#find_by_email
  in mock gds api user warden strategy, to make
  it compatible with apps using mongoid.

# 9.2.0

* UX fix to check whether remotely signed out user
  signed-in again to let them continue. otherwise,
  ask them to login again.

# 8.0.0

* The controllers provided by gds-sso no longer inherit from an application's
  ApplicationController, and instead inherit directly from
  ActionController::Base.

# 7.0.0

* Changed "organisation" to "organisation_slug"

# 6.0.0 (Not recommended, see version 7.0.0)

# 5.0.0 (Not recommended, see version 7.0.0)

  "organisations", which is an array of organisation slugs sourced from
  https://whitehall-admin.production.alphagov.co.uk/api/organisations

# 4.0.0

* Removed support for basic authentication. Please use Bearer token
  authentication instead. This means creating API users and granting them
